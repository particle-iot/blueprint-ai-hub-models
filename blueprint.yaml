introduction: |
  Welcome to the **Qualcomm AI Hub Models Blueprint App** for Particle! 

  This blueprint enables seamless execution of AI models from Qualcomm’s AI Hub on your Linux-based edge device. By leveraging Particle’s IoT platform, you can dynamically download and run AI models inside a Docker container with minimal setup.

description: |
  The Qualcomm AI Hub Models blueprint allows you to deploy and execute AI models from the Qualcomm AI Hub repository on supported edge devices like Tachyon and Raspberry Pi. 
  - Uses Docker to containerize and execute AI models.
  - Supports running models dynamically by fetching them from the AI Hub repository.
  - Integrated with PartiQL’s IoT platform for seamless model execution and deployment.
  
  This is an ideal starting point for AI-powered applications running at the edge.
